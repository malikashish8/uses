# üîê uses - USE Secure environment variables in dev

[![.github/workflows/release.yaml](https://github.com/malikashish8/uses/actions/workflows/release.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/malikashish8/uses/actions/workflows/release.yaml)

Taking inspiration from [aws-vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vaults), `uses` makes `use` of OS provided `s`ecret management solutions to save secrets in the development environment. Grouping of secrets is made possible by a config file.

Having secrets lying around in environment variables in the development environment can be a nightmare as opensource packages are being [actively compromised](https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/pypi-package-ctx-and-php-library-phpass.html) to steal secrets. These packages can read all the environment variables. Good security hygine dictates that no secrets are stored in environment variables (using configs such as ~/.bashrc and ~/.zshrc). `uses` helps to implement the least privilege principle by saving all the secrets in a secret store and explicitly allowing processes to access the required secrets.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Installation
Install from binary
```bash
wget https://github.com/malikashish8/uses/releases/latest/download/uses-darwin-amd64.tar.gz
tar -zxf uses-* && mv uses /usr/bin
```

Or if you have golang installed run the following command to install
```bash
go install github.com/malikashish8/uses@latest
```

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage

```
‚ùØ uses                   
NAME:
   uses - securely manage secrets in dev environment

USAGE:
   uses [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]

VERSION:
   v0.0.9

COMMANDS:
   project1    get secrets for project `project1` and run command
   webgoat     get secrets for project `webgoat` and run command
   config, c   locate config file
   set, s      set a secret `name=value`
   get, g      get secret for a `name`
   list, l     list all secrets saved using `uses`
   remove, r   delete a `secret`
   completion  generate auto-complete commands for a shell
   help, h     Shows a list of commands or help for one command

GLOBAL OPTIONS:
   --help, -h     show help (default: false)
   --version, -v  print the version (default: false)
```

### Set
Set a secret in secret store
```bash
‚ùØ uses set GITHUB_TOKEN
Overwrite value? (y/n) y
Enter value: 
INFO[0009] GITHUB_TOKEN saved
```
Set in one line (unsafe) 
```bash
‚ùØ uses set GITHUB_TOKEN=sdknbowhlfownpns;s/dkfnbslsnwwn
```
Above will save the secret in prompt history. A safer way is to use `pbpaste` on Mac:
```bash
‚ùØ uses set $(pbpaste)
```
or if the secret is already in the environment
```bash
‚ùØ uses set GITHUB_TOKEN=${GITHUB_TOKEN}
```

### Get
Get a secret from secret store
```bash
‚ùØ uses get GITHUB_TOKEN
sdknbowhlfownpns;s/dkfnbslsnwwn
```
Get can also run any command passed to it after setting the environment variable
```bash
‚ùØ uses get GITHUB_TOKEN env | grep GITHUB_TOKEN
GITHUB_TOKEN=sdknbowhlfownpns;s/dkfnbslsnwwn
```

### Enable Auto-completion
#### ZSH
```bash
echo 'source <(uses completion zsh)' >>~/.zshrc
```

#### BASH
```bash
echo 'source <(uses completion bash)' >>~/.bashrc
```

### List
Get a list of secrets managed by `uses`
```bash
‚ùØ uses list
[AWS_USER, GITHUB_TOKEN]
```

### Projects
Inject a number of environment variables while running a command
```bash
‚ùØ uses webgoat code ~/projects/webgoat
INFO[0000] Starting child process: code /Users/u/projects/webgoat
```
This mapping of projects to environment variables is stored in a config file:
```yaml
project:
- name: webgoat
  secrets:
  - GITHUB_TOKEN
- name: project1
  secrets:
  - AWS_USER
  - GITHUB_TOKEN
```

Location of the config file can be found using 
```bash
‚ùØ uses config
config file location: /Users/u/.config/uses/config.yaml
```
